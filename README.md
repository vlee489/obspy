ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a **Python framework for processing seismological** data. It provides parsers for common file formats, clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of seismological time series (see [Beyreuther et al. 2010](http://www.seismosoc.org/publications/SRL/SRL_81/srl_81-3_es/), [Megies et al. 2011](http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/4838)).

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate **rapid application development for seismology**.
